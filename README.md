# Parental Control Smart Contract

## 📘 Project Description

The **Parental Control Smart Contract** is a blockchain-based solution that enables parents to regulate and monitor their child’s spending in a secure, transparent, and trustless manner. Built using Solidity for Ethereum-compatible networks, this smart contract offers real-time control and budget limitations over digital allowances.

## 👁️ Project Vision

The vision of this project is to empower families with decentralized financial tools that provide safety, transparency, and autonomy. It aims to build a foundation of trust between parents and children while fostering responsible digital spending habits in younger users.

## 🔑 Key Features

- **Spending Limit**: Parents can set daily spending limits for the child.
- **Time Lock**: Withdrawals by the child are limited to once per day.
- **Emergency Withdrawals**: Parents can retrieve all funds in emergencies.
- **Contract Balance View**: Anyone can view the available balance in the contract.
- **Parent-Controlled Access**: Only the designated parent can update settings or perform withdrawals.

## 🔮 Future Scope

- **Multi-child Support**: Extend the contract to manage multiple children under a single parent account.
- **Allowance Scheduling**: Automate weekly/monthly allowance distribution.
- **Spending Reports**: Generate logs or reports on withdrawal history.
- **Mobile DApp Integration**: Build a mobile-friendly decentralized app (DApp) for easier usage.
- **Gamification**: Introduce rewards or penalties based on spending behavior.
